# TalkingEyes: Pluralistic Speech-Driven 3D Eye Gaze Animation

## Talking Eyes Dataset (TKED)
TKED consists of 5,982 videos featuring 669 subjects, amounting to approximately 14 hours of footage in total. Out of the 5,982 videos, 5,912 are from [VoxCeleb2](https://mm.kaist.ac.kr/datasets/voxceleb/), with a total duration of about 12 hours, while the remaining 70 videos are from [HDTF](https://github.com/MRzzm/HDTF), totaling about 2 hours. 

We have conducted 3D face reconstruction and 3D eye gaze fitting on each frame of these videos to obtain the pseudo ground truth [FLAME](https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/) parameters, which include **two eyeballs' rotation, head rotation and facial motion parameters**. 

Along with the audio stored in the original videos, **TKED is first dataset in the research community to simultaneously contain the three types of resources: 3D talking eyes, 3D talking head and 3D talking faces**.
